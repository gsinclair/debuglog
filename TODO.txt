* Get it working in 1.8.7
   - one failing test at the moment
* See if it works in 1.8.6
   - Whitestone doesn't work in 1.8.6 (and never will) so I can only test
     it by tring it


Future features

* Colour, whether directly (:red, etc.) or indirectly (traces are yellow,
  timings are cyan, strings with !! are red, ...)

* Blacklist and/or whitelist (maybe)
    Debuglog.blacklist :foo
    debug :foo, "Blah blah blah"   # Will not be printed.
